                <h2>Sustainable Future</h2>
                <p>
                    Everybody has the right to be treated with respect and dignity. Poverty reduction is the key to give people hope, pride and a better future.

                <h2>Valuing Forests</h2>
                <p>
                    The pressure on the forests is growing through unsustainable timber logging, charcoal burning, illegal poaching and shifting cultivation practices. We give value to trees through active and continuous demand for produce. Our supplier groups process high quality raw materials for our oils maintaining sustainable harvesting practices.

                <p>
                    Zambia is a signatory of the Nagoya protocol. At Kalahari BioCare we follow the UN BioTrade Principles & Criteria for use of Terrestrial Biodiversity to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits generated from the utilisation of forest resources.

                    Over the years, we have established relationships with the remote rural communities from whom we source high quality raw materials. The work is mainly done by women. This gives these women additional cash income, more opportunities and independence.
